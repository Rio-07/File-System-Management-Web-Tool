File System Recovery and Optimization Tool üõ†Ô∏è
Overview
The File System Recovery and Optimization Tool is a Python-based utility designed to help users scan, recover, and optimize files within a given directory. It efficiently scans for missing or fragmented files, restores them from a backup, and renames files systematically to ensure a well-organized structure.

This tool is useful for:

Data recovery from backup directories

File organization by renaming files in a structured manner

Maintaining system integrity by logging operations

It also features a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the backend seamlessly.
